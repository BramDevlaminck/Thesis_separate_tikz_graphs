# TikZ graphs
This repo contains separate latex files that each contain 1 tikz graph.
These graphs are used in my presentation, but are not needed in my thesis.

# installation
latex should be installed together with the `standalone` package.
Installing this `standalone` package can be done using

```sh
sudo tlmgr install standalone
```

# execution
run `make` in this directory
